# Adroit Server

## What Is It

This is a small HTTP server made using the NodeJS NET API with support for major HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, header creation, HTTP status codes and proper error handling. The server also aims to support various mediatypes like text/html, text/xml, application/json, application/x-www-form-urlencoded and more. 

## Motivations

* To understand the inner-workings of web servers.
* To understand the different HTTP methods and how servers process client requests for the different methods. 
* To understand how servers receive payloads and how they process them.
* To understand how servers map paths/URIs to specific methods.
